# AWS-Yelp-SentimentScope
Developed a Python-based Yelp dataset analysis pipeline that processes and splits data into 10 structured JSON files, stored efficiently in AWS S3 buckets. Leveraged Snowflakeâ€™s cloud data platform to create an SQL database, where I built tables (yelp_businesses and yelp_reviews) to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews. This end-to-end project demonstrates expertise in data engineering, cloud storage (S3), and Snowflake SQL integration, providing actionable insights from large-scale review data.
